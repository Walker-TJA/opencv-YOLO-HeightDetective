# opencv-YOLO-HeightDetective
Fun program that estimates your height with ~90% accuracy! AND makes fun of you to! (sorry not sorry, go drink more milk)
It uses YOLO machine learning and opencv to calculate the users height. Stand 10 feet away with your camera 3 feet tall and let the trash talk begin! (more fun with friends and fam)
To use this program. Make sure you have python 3.13.1 installed (duh)
Run the following in a virtual environment (Extremely Recommended to be in a venv)
pip install ultralytics
pip install opencv-python
pip install opencv-contrib-python
That should be it. Go to the issues tab if this needs to be updated!
EXE WILL INSTALL ONE DEPENDENCY IF COMPILED, DO NOT FREAK OUT!!!
